# Celestial Leeway
 
 Hi! I'm Halley, this is my first attempt at making a mod for Outer Wilds- Celestial Leeway!

## Credits

I utilized the mod New Horizons to create this, and UnityExplorer to gather the assets needed for the planet's... "decor".

A big thank you to everybody in the Outer Wilds Modding Discord for helping me create my first true project, and, in all honesty, giving me the mental boost that I needed!
